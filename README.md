# 🌱 Plantzen

A full-stack IoT plant monitoring platform built using **React**, **Firebase Realtime Database**, **Docker**, and **n8n** for workflow automation.  
This system allows real-time data monitoring from ESP32 devices, including soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, battery level, and network strength.

## 🚀 Features

### 🖥️ Frontend (React + Vite)
- Modern UI for Sign Up, Sign In, and Dashboard
- TailwindCSS styling with responsive design
- Real-time sensor data updates via Firebase listeners
- Device pairing through unique ESP32 codes
- Protected routes (Dashboard only accessible when logged in)
- LocalStorage-based session authentication

### 🔥 Backend (Firebase Realtime Database)
- Stores user accounts and paired devices
- Stores sensor readings and device metadata
- Uses environment variables (`.env`) for secure config
- Real-time synchronization across devices & frontend
- Simple to upgrade to Firebase Auth in the future

### 🐳 Docker Deployment
- Custom Docker image for running the frontend
- Supports Vite development server
- Hot reload compatible
- Multi-stage build option ready
